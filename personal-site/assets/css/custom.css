/*
  This rule applies a filter to elements with the class 'dark:invert'
  when they are inside an element with the class 'dark'.
  This is commonly used for dark mode themes to visually invert colors
  (e.g., turning black text white and white backgrounds black)
  and adjust hue/brightness for better readability in dark mode.

/*
  This rule applies to elements with the class 'footnote-body'.
  'display: contents;' makes the 'footnote-body' element itself
  "disappear" from the layout tree. It doesn't render its own box,
  but its children are rendered directly as if they were children
  of the 'footnote-body's parent element.
  This is useful for restructuring the DOM visually without changing
  the actual HTML structure. In this case, it helps to eliminate
  the line break that a <div> (which 'footnote-body' likely is)
  would normally create.

.footnote-body {
    display: contents;

/*
  This rule targets all direct children (>) of elements with the class 'footnote-body'.
  'display: inline;' makes these child elements behave like inline content,
  meaning they will flow on the same line as surrounding text and
  only take up as much width as their content requires.
  This is crucial in conjunction with 'display: contents;' on the parent
  (.footnote-body) to prevent the children from creating new line breaks.
  Without this, even if '.footnote-body' disappears, its children (e.g., <p> tags)
  would still act as block-level elements and force new lines.
